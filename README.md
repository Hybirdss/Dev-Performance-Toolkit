## 🔒 Safety Features

### Automatic Backups

All scripts create backups before making changes:

- Windows: `backups/network-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`
- macOS: `backups/network-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`

### Reversible Changes

Every optimization can be reverted using backup files.

### Administrator Checks

Scripts verify elevated privileges before execution and prompt for confirmation.
